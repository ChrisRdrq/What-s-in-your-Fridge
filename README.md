# What's in your Fridge?

## Overview

For WDI project #2, I created a web application called Americana. Americana is the explorer's guide to the National Parks.

The app allows users to create an account and log in. The user can then view a list of all National Parks, as well as park-specific details, including location, description, and weather info. I used JSON data from the National Park Service Data API to create these pages.

The user can add national parks to her personal bucket list. Once the user visits a park, she can remove the park from her bucket list.
